\description{
  \code{read_authors} This function extracts authors from a
  read_references format data.frame object, uses a
  Jaro-Winkler comparison of first names to try to match
  authors with multiple Last Name, Initial combinations,
  filling in potential matches using the AU_ID_Dupe and
  Similarity fields in the resulting output.  The output is
  a list containing two data.frame objects, one named
  authors and the other authors__references, which is a
  linking table that links authors by the AU_ID field to
  references data via the UT (Web of Knowledge ID) field.
